# RBF-model-partitional-approximation-control-for-single-manipulator
Adaptive control of robot manipulator RBF network based on model partitional approximation, reference to [1] and [2], 3 RBF networks are used to approximateinertia matrix, Coriolis matrix and gravity matrix respectively, considering single robotic manipulation.
